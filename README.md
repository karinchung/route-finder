## How to Use

Anyone can see all of the routes that users have input into the site.

**Adding a Route**

To add your own route you must have an account.

Once you have an account simply click on the map and a marker and modal will appear with your potential route details.

You can name your route and give it a rating before submitting it.

Now anyone can click on the new route marker (official when it's indicated in red instead of grey) and see your route details.

**Deleting and Editing a Route**

Only the site admin can delete or edit routes. To request that your route be deleted or edited please contact us. This is done to preserve and mantain routes that users are looking out for.
